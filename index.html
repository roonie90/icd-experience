    <h2>What is an ICD?</h2>
    <p>An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a small but life-saving electronic device placed inside the chest to monitor and correct abnormal heart rhythms. For individuals at risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), particularly those with ventricular arrhythmias, an ICD serves as a silent guardian—constantly analyzing the heart’s rhythm and delivering an electric shock when necessary to restore a normal heartbeat. This technology can make the difference between life and death in critical moments.</p>
    <p>Beyond its clinical function, understanding how an ICD works, when it intervenes, and what it feels like to live with one can greatly reduce fear and anxiety. Knowing your device’s purpose and capabilities empowers you to take control of your heart health with confidence and clarity.</p>
